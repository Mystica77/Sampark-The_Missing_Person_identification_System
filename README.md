## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

1. **Face Detection**  
   Uses MTCNN to detect faces in input images.
   
2. **Feature Extraction**  
   FaceNet model converts faces into 128-dimensional embedding vectors.

3. **Matching**  
   An SVM classifier matches new embeddings against a database of known (missing/found) individuals.

4. **Prediction Output**  
   Returns the most likely match along with confidence score.
